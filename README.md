### TOPIC: ICONOGRAPHY IN ART HISTORY
This study will specifically focus on the depicted objects rather than delving into the interpretation of iconographic subjects.

### BACKGROUND
The Renaissance, synonymous with profound social change across various domains, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration, and science, originated in the Italian peninsula. By the 16th century, it had left an indelible mark on European intellectual life. This cultural movement significantly influenced art, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other intellectual realms. Renaissance scholars embraced the humanist method, seeking realism and human emotion in art. As a pivotal cultural movement, how did the Renaissance reflect in art? Widely recognized, particularly for Italian artists, how did the iconography change and evolve during this transformative period?

### GOALS
The goal is to discover trends in iconographic subjects during the Italian Renaissance (15th and 16th centuries) by identifying the most frequently represented objects in paintings and exploring correlations between these subjects and geographical locations.

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What subjects are most commonly depicted in artworks during the Italian Renaissance?
2. How does the iconography evolve over time?
3. In which geographical locations are certain objects/subjects more likely to be depicted?

### DATA PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS
The project involves retrieving data from the [*Iconology Dataset*](https://w3id.org/icon/data/) and [*Zeri Photo Archive RDF Dataset*](https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/5497/). After a preliminary analysis of the sources, the aim is to uncover the distribution of iconographic subjects on the Italian peninsula and the various objects depicted by visual artists.

### DATA COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES
The project will start with a preliminary exploratory visualization of the numbers of artworks and artists under consideration. Iconography trends will be visually represented over time and across geographical regions, with a specific focus on the Italian peninsula.

### SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The results will be summarized to draw meaningful quantitative conclusions.
